Website Subject 
- Restaurant Review Website
Website Description
- A Blog with reviews and photos of food
Interactive map/Location
- Reviewed restaurants will become pinned on an interactive map showing the surroundings of Seattle.
And become accessible with just a click. You can find information, where it is, and reviews made of the restaurant.
This purpose is to provide users with a way to choose where they’d like to eat if they’d like it to be in a certain part of Seattle.
Whether that’s downtown, Capitol Hill, around UW, and more. 
About Us
- It’s important to highlight the creators of the website and provide a more personal connection from those who are curious to get to know who is behind the website's idea. 
Website Purpose
- The goal of our website is to serve as a point of access for visitors and locals alike to the vast breadth of the Seattle food scene.
The city and the surrounding areas foster a vibrant restaurant environment with both classic staples and an innumerable amount of new culinary experiences.
With the variety available and the sheer number of restaurants it can be difficult to both find things like local favorites or make an informed decision on if a restaurant
is worth the real time and money sink that eating out requires. Our website aims to streamline this process through a comprehensive review platform powered by those who share
the perspective of the average user and the average diner in the Seattle area. It is with this more focused view that we seek to provide a deeper more personal touch to the common
review format. 
Team Plan
- Each week our group will actively engage in our shared Teams chat, along with our personal group messages to stay on top of weekly tasks.
Along with splitting and enlisting tasks to each other to ensure that work is divided up as evenly as possible and tasks can get done as organized as they can be. 
We will also make sure to incorporate our own individual ideas and brainstorm together as a group. That way our own creative takes on different designs can be implemented
within our website and its design. An example of how we recently did this is we enlisted tasks for our first project milestone this week by having everyone do their own wireframe
idea for our website. Although we all have an idea of what it’s about and what it’ll look like, we sketched out our own designs and shared them with each other. We realized all of
our wireframe designs are slightly different and are planning to integrate different aspects of each of our designs into our final webpage wireframe.
