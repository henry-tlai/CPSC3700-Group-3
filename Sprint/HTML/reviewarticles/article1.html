                <p>Tried the new Koko's Restaurant in Cap Hill and the vibe was excellent, the music was great, drinks were delicious, and the food was authentic!</p>
                <p>Only stopped by for a couple of drinks and a side, but it's very homey and welcoming and a great place for a fancy night out or get together with friends. </p>
                <p>I tried the chips and salsa, and it was fresh, homemade, and incredibly yummy!</p>
